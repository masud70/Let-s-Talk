# Let's Talk!

**Let's Talk!** is a very simple chatting application made with NextJS and ExpressJS. The main intention and purpose for this application is to connect with friends while internet services was shutdown in Bangladesh from July 18, 2024. As the connection was as there and we could access the server with the IP addresses in Bangladesh, I took advantages of that. I have hosted this application on my own PC and connected with my home router. As a result, it was able to access the app throughout Bangladesh by hitting the my IP address. It was actually fun for me.

## Prerequisites

- MySQL (see `backend/model/config.json` for configuration)

## Run the System

One can easily run the application with the commands below (download first):

```bash
// Run backend
cd backend
npm run dev

// Run frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

I you want to run the application in production mode, just compile the application first and then run. (I did not try for this application as development continued while using.)


***Have Fun!!***
